            <h1>Influence on the Algorithm</h1>
            <p>MrBeast built the LARGEST channel on YouTube by using a simple yet effective formula: extravagant challenges + enormous giveaways. His videos often involve tens to hundreds of thousands of of dollars in cash, setting a new standard for the content that is popular on YouTube. Many creators now feel compelled to replicate this high-budget approach to success online. The focus has shifted content that is personal and a way to expressive yourself creatively to "how big can you go?"</p>
            <p>The YouTube algorithm plays a major role in the rise of MrBeast-style content. Videos that promise viral moments, large rewards, or shocking spectacles are more likely to be recommended. As a result, smaller, more niche creators are left struggling for views. What once was a platform where creativity thrived now largely favors sensationalism and instant gratification, reinforcing the dominance of large-scale, money-driven content.</p>
